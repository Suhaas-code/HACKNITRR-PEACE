1. Open "TheParkingSpot.pdf" to learn about our Project.  
2. Run "sketch_pSpot.ino" on arduino to start the Project.  
3. Install "TheParkingSpot.apk" on an android device to test our Working App (WebApp).  
4. Snapshots of working model : "WorkingPrototype.jpeg".


### Version 1.1 
**What's working :**  
_The Web-app is completely functional._  

**Expect in later versions :**  
_Notification API to work on live feed from the arduino board, this will let the app to show the parking location of your vehicle._  
_Augmented Reality based navigation, minimal animated interface to show arrows, probably based on Material You theming engine (Android 12)._
